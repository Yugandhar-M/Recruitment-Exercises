### Q1 
**Assumptions I made in profanity check:**
* Each sentence in 'in.txt' is a single tweet
* All profanity words are available in 'profanity_words.txt' 

Profanity index in above is defined as ratio of count of profanity words to that of total number of words in sentence.
The notebook of solution can be found [here](https://github.com/Yugandhar-M/Recruitment-Exercises/blob/main/Affinity%20Answers/profanity_check.ipynb).

### Q2
Genuinenly speaking I have not worked on high number of complex datasets apart from my course exercises.
But recently I did worked on following dataset as a part of recruitment for one company.

**Dataset:**
* [This](https://github.com/Yugandhar-M/Conduira-Internship/blob/main/Evaluation_Tasks/activity_data.csv) file data related to activity performed by users on OTT platform.
* [This](https://github.com/Yugandhar-M/Conduira-Internship/blob/main/Evaluation_Tasks/data.csv) file has actual movies and related information.
* [This](https://github.com/Yugandhar-M/Conduira-Internship/blob/main/Evaluation_Tasks/output.csv) is expected output file to be generated from above two files of data.

The reason I really appreciate this data is it's structure of raw data. In order to combine both input files based on activity, we first need to clean them in some common format. But that is a way critical. Without in-built library **ast (Abstract Syntax Tree)**, it is really difficult to clean that data.
The actual solution of mine using python is [here](https://github.com/Yugandhar-M/Conduira-Internship/blob/main/Evaluation_Tasks/join_data.py)

### Q3
You mentioned correctly that is Data is new Oil. Everyone wants to store their data. But they also interested in using that data in future. So, the technology that supports looking back into our data more quickly and efficiently is very crucial. 

That is why database is very important. It helps us store our data in a more structured format with a support of retrieving data more quickly. It helps us in entire life of data i.e. Entry stage (we can enter data very easily and ordered manner) till Exit stage(we can get it back whenever we want.)

There is no way comparision between a database and a simple txt file. The key differences being:
* Looking back into our data is more efficient and quick in Database
* We can manage various people dealing with data using a Database (admins, users etc...)
* Database in comparision with txt is more secure
* Sharing of data across world can be managed using Database

And many more...

I am good enough in doing my job using Unix Commands(dealing with directories, copying and moving files et...) though I do not have an expertise in that.

But I can assure you that I will learn them as in when needed to serve the purpose.
